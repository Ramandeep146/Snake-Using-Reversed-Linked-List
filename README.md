# Snake-Using-Reversed-Linked-List
My own version of classic 2d snake game in which the snake grows by 1 size after eating an apple. The player can also reverse the snakeâ€™s direction anytime i.e., the head becomes the tail, and the tail becomes the head.  

- Implemented singly linked list to store the body of snake.
- Reverse the snake by reversing the linked list.



Controls:

- To change the directions of the Snake:
   - Right: Right Arrow Key
   - Left: Left Arrow Key
   - Up: Up Arrow Key
   - Down: Down Arrow Key

- To reverse the Snake press "Space" Key

- To reset the game after "Game Over" press 'R' Key


Time taken to complete the project: 5 days
